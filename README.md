# 2024-YVR-Smart-Airport-Hackathon
YVR Airport is the second busiest airport in Canada servicing nearly 30 million passengers per year. Airport operations are a complex effort involving government, regulators, partners, airlines, ground handlers, contractors, travelers, the community and so many more.


## Who Are We
YVR is the largest building in British Columbia, covering an impressive 378,255 square meters. With over 70 gates, 56
airlines, and 124 destinations, YVR is a hub for international travel.

Our facility maintenance team is composed of 80 highly skilled professionals, working alongside contracted services to
ensure the airport operates safely and at a high standard. At any given moment, over 50 individuals could be on site,
performing different aspects of facility upkeep.

We use software platforms to monitor and receive alerts from our installed assets. This allows us to stay ahead of
potential issues and address them quickly. In addition, we rely on our business partners and stakeholders to help
identify and report any problems with non-interface hardware such as tiles or windows.

At YVR, we are committed to providing a world-class travel experience, and our maintenance and upkeep teams play a
critical role in making that possible.


## Challenge: Efficient and Healthy Building
Every evening, the airport building management system adjusts temperature set points to conserve energy. However, the rate of temperature change varies across different areas, and the airport seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms causing these variations.

Develop a solution, either static or non-static, to determine the factors influencing temperature changes in different spaces within the airport building. Leverage cutting-edge technologies such as intelligent sensors, computer vision, and machine learning to identify why temperature is lost or gained.


## Challenge: Expectations
* Utilize intelligent sensors and data collection techniques to gather temperature data from various spaces and features within the airport building. 
* Apply computer vision algorithms to analyze thermal images or video feeds to detect heat sources, insulation issues, or other factors influencing temperature changes. 
* Employ machine learning models to identify patterns and correlations between temperature fluctuations and potential causal factors, such as occupancy levels, sunlight exposure, HVAC performance, or structural properties. 
* Quantify the observed temperature variations and provide insights into the magnitude of the issue across different areas of the airport building. 
* Offer mitigation solutions that do not compromise the aesthetics of the building, such as optimizing HVAC scheduling, improving insulation, implementing smart zoning strategies, or enhancing energy-efficient architectural designs.
